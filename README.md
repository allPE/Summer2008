# Summer2018
This project contains instructions and source code for the Pi projects for the July 24th "All PE" meeting.  Your Raspberi Pi image will have git installed so if needed you can get the latest and greatest from this repo. Within a Pi shell and your desired project directory (example shows home directory) simply run:
```
username@pi:~$ git clone https://github.com/allPE/Summer2018.git
```
